Then he got the Ohio State job.

131
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:12,287
Right. And then
he lost the Ohio State job

132
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:14,960
for losing it
on one of his players.

133
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:17,061
He bounced around
internationally for a while.

134
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,998
Now he's an assistant coach
for the Iowa Stallions.

135
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,539
Now, he didn't like
what the head coach drew up,

136
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:25,234
and, look,
he goes all WWE on his boss.

Huh. You were the last person
I expected to see, Phil.

179
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,832
We go back too far, Marcus.

180
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,966
You know what a meme is?

181
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,429
You're a meme now.

182
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:36,134
My granddaughter
sent this to me.

183
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,708
She's been sharing
with all her little friends.

Oh. At least it's pretty funny.

186
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:45,044
No. It's not.

187
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,881
It's not funny.

188
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,278
All right. Okay.

189
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:50,544
I-I messed up, obviously,

190
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,447
and I... I'm sorry.

191
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:55,857
-You don't sound sorry.
-Well, I am sorry.

192
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:59,025
I mean, I'm not entirely sorry.

193
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,126
I mean, should I apologize

194
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,798
for wanting to win
a basketball game?

195
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,624
By knocking me on my ass?

196
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,737
Look, I... I'm frustrated
because you never listen to me.

197
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,564
I told you
that lob play was dumb.

198
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,841
If you'd have run
the split action with Derrick...

199
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,338
Do you know why I didn't run
the play with Derrick?

200
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,241
(stammers) A misdirection maybe,

201
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,309
but at least use him
as a decoy and...

202
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:21,641
His grandmother
is in the hospital.

203
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,753
She had a stroke.

204
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,084
Mm. Okay.

205
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,680
Well, I mean, she's old, right?

206
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:30,551
It shouldn't matter, Marcus!
The woman raised him.

207
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:33,554
Look, he was upset.
His head wasn't in the game.

208
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,424
But you wouldn't know that

209
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,866
because you don't bother
to get to know any of the guys.

210
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:39,428
What do you mean?
I know the guys.

211
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,936
I-I know
Jinky can't go to his left,

212

As people! Human beings.

214
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,570
Look, Marcus, you know the game

215
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:55,279
better than anybody I have ever
played or coached with, but...

216
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:57,050
(scoffs)

217
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:59,052

Okay.

219
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,682
That-that is so adorable.

220
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,959
(stammers) What, are we living
in<i> Hoosiers</i> now,

221
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:06,455
and I should go home and work on

222
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,392
my inspirational
locker room speeches?

223
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,460
You were a prick in college,
and you haven't changed.

224
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:15,200
That's why
you never stick anywhere.

225
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:18,269
Ohio State. Greece. Turkey.

226
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,403
Oh, now, Turkey,
that was strictly

227
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:22,273
a language barrier issue.

228
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,814
You literally kicked a player
in his behind,

229
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,574
bruised his coccyx.

230
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:28,708
And he spoke English.
The kid was from Detroit.

00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,612

She's the toughest judge
in Des Moines.

I'm not doing that.

00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:46,060
Okay, I'm gonna ask you this,

No, I'm not drunk.

'cause I've had several.

One of us needs to be straight.

-Boo-boo word.

283
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,190
Mr. Marakovich,
would you like me

284
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,994
to add contempt of court
to the list?

285
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,359
Because it seems to me
you have enough charges as is.

286
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:23,163
No, Judge, that's plenty.

287
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:24,164
It's "Your Honor."

288
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,232
Your Honor. Sorry.

289
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:29,532
I'm gonna make you an offer,
Mr. Marakovich.

290
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,941
Now, I understand you are
a professional basketball coach.

291
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:33,206
Is that correct?

292
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,945
-Uh, yes, Your Honor.
-Okay.

293
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,947
In light of that information,

294
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:39,740
I will offer you
community service:

295
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,280
coaching at a local rec center.

296
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:43,249
Community service?
I-- No, I can't...

297
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,120
-Uh, a moment to confer,
Your Honor. -Yes.

298
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:47,924
(whispering): Just shut up,
you lucky son of a bitch.

299
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,519

I'm not feeling lucky.

300
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:50,927

-That's the ju...
-But community service?

302
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,096
I need to be in other cities
wh-where I'm gonna be working.

303
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,757
-(sighs)
-I can't stay in Des Moines.

304
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,792
I-I can't take
community service.

305
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:01,729
Oh. You can't take
community service? Okay.

306
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,830
So, uh,
with that in mind, then...

307
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,635
...you are hereby sentenced
to serve

308
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,901
18 months incarceration
in prison.

309
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,540
Time to be served at...

310
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,378
Uh, uh, I-I-I do apologize,
uh, Your Honor.

311
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:14,709
I think there's some kind of
misapprehension here because

312
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:18,251
-we were talking about...
I said... -Hmm?

313
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:21,584
We both were talking when you
said, "Take community service."

314
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,784
I don't... I don't want
to take comm--

315
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,786
I want to give to the community.

316
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,722
I want to give freely.

317
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:31,132
I'm all ears.
Wh-What did you have in mind?

318
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,397
Good decision, Mr. Marakovich.

319
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,168
As I was saying,

320
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:38,733
I will offer you
90 days' community service,

321
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:41,472

with intellectual disabilities

322

"intellectual disabilities,"

325
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,085
what are we talking here?

326
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,911

reflect on me going forward,

If I can't say the "R" word,
what-what do I, uh, call them?

May I suggest you call them
by their names?

Okay, fellas,
my name is Marcus Marakovich,

352
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,854
and I am going to be
your basketball coach

353
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,053
for the next three months.

Nope.

Whoa.

I love animals.

My sister's an actress.
My dog's name is Peaches.

Johnny, that-that is
one funky musk

you got going there, brother.

367

What do you say we end this hug
right about now?

Okay.

Wow.

Whew. Okay.

00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,566
My eyes are watering.

372

Let's, uh, let's take a knee.

373
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,274
Coach, I didn't know
we'd be kneeling,

374
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:27,770
so I didn't wear my knee pads,

375
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,475
and I'm worried about
my patella.

376
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,939
Your patella?
Okay, well, you can stand.

377

-Thanks.
-That's Marlon.

-He works in the best
restaurant in town. -O-Okay.

383
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,786
Uh, there's plenty of time
to get acquainted later, Johnny,

384
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:47,163
but for now, let's everybody,
uh, partner up.

385
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:49,627
Uh, Coach?
I don't need a partner.

386
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:51,123
I've got a girlfriend.

387
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,795
Wonderful.

388
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,599
Actually, I got two.

No, you don't.

390
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,340
It's the same girl.
She just changes her hair.

391
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,276
And she knows how to get around.

So what?

Why can't she have
a lot of boyfriends?

-No, you don't.

00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:14,949
They're best friends.

399
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,885
They live in a group home.
I'm gonna live there, too.

400
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,293
Okay, Johnny.

401
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,691
Um... I'll tell you what.

Let's everybody stand up.

we're going to do

410
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:43,714
a simple ball-handling exercise.

411

Uh, my girlfriend loves those.

00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:49,016
Can you just forget
your girlfriend for a minute?

414
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,391
You can play with her later.

415
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:53,053
We don't play. We have sex.

416
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:56,089
I go to her place, and we do it.

417
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,432
-All the sex moves.
-Mm-hmm.

00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:10,675
Okay.

420
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,974
Watch, Coach.

421
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:17,517
Big balls. Yeah.

422
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,112
What's that guy's deal?

423
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:21,752
-Showtime? He's a specialist.
-A specialist?

424
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,622
Yeah, he's the only player
in the league

425
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:26,493
who shoots backwards from half
court, and he's on our team.

426
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,562
Pretty good shot, huh, Coach?

427
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:32,125
No, that's a terrible shot.

428
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:37,273
Now, that's a good shot.

429
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,802
Looking good there, Darius.

430
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:41,134
Nope. I'm not playing for you.

This is impossible.

Hey, don't worry about it.

436
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,728
You'll have them all done
before you know it.

437
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,830
No, no,
I-I'm talking about the team.

438
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:10,306
It-It's impossible
to coach these guys.

439
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:13,166
You know,
impossible is not a fact.

440
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,772
It's an opinion.

Please don't quote
cat posters to me.

Special Olympics athletes.

You don't have to turn them
into the Lakers.

444
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,520
They just need
to feel like a team.

445
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,280
You know, I snuck
a couple peeks in there today.

446
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:29,754
It looks like
you were doing good.

447
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:30,821
Doing good?

448
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,823
I-I didn't coach any basketball.

449
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:35,188
I was mostly hearing about
Craig's girlfriend.

450
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:37,333
Uh-huh. Huh. I hear he has two.

451
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:39,599
Well, it's not clear.

452
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:41,964
You know, the one guy
who can actually play

453
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,196
won't play for me.

454
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,297
Yeah, Darius.

455
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:46,804
Ah, you know what?

456
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,004
I... I don't, I don't care.

457
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,270
I-I just...

458
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,547
(sighs)

459
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,978
By the way,
what-what happened to the guy

460
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:57,518
who was coaching before me?

461
00:19:57,553 --> 00:20:00,455
Oh, we don't talk about him.

462
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,457
They kill him?

463
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,623
No.

464
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,020
(chuckles):
No, no.

465
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,021
He quit before
the season was over.

466
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:08,320
The team was very upset.

467
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:10,223
(sighs) Right.

468
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,730
But we won't have
that problem with you

-That sucks.
-Yeah.

536
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:52,693
But at least
we're finally hanging out.

537
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:54,189
You got a great place here.

538
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:55,630
Yep.

539
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,126
Uh, hey, by the way,

540
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:58,633
(clears throat)
let me ask you something.

541
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,197
-I cannot stay out
the entire season. -Mm-mm.

542
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:05,332
And I've been working
my, uh, connections,

543
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,334
but it occurs to me that

544
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,843
your uncle is one of the most
respected GMs in basketball.

545
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:15,474
And is it possible you could
talk to him and help me out?

546
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,750
Absolutely.

547
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,587
(chuckles):
Yeah?

548
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:21,051
-Yeah.
-Oh.

549
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:24,054
(stammers) But I don't want it
to be, you know, minor league.

550
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:27,596
-I-I want it to be the NBA.
-Yeah.

551
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:30,258
You know, fifth assistant,
uh, player development,

552
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:32,425
whatever it is, NBA.

553
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,328
Gotcha. I'm on it.

554
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,604
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

555
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,101
I knew it. I knew it.

556
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,498
-You're the man.
-You're the man.

557
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,840
-No, you're the man.
-No.

558
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,744
Sir, you are the man.

559
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:47,374
All right, I am the man.

560
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,848
-You're right.
-(laughs)

561
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:51,114
Hey, you know what?

562
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:54,084
After I talk to my uncle,
we should go out.

563
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,592
Hit the clurb.
Get crunk. Get crazy.

564
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:57,923
-(chuckles)
-And I'll give you the update.

565
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,793
Listen.

566
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:01,630
I got an idea.

567
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:02,763
Text me.

568
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,798
Lunch, then.

569
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:09,429
Okay, guys,
today we're gonna work on

570
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,365
the fundamentals of passing.

571
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,708
Arthur, come over here,
help me out.

572
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,810
All right? Now, we're gonna
start with the bounce pass.

573
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,075
You ready?

574
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,979
Okay, you see that?

575
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:23,476
Thumbs behind the ball,
flick of the wrist, bounce pass.

576
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,280
Right? Got it?

577
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:26,919
Okay, throw it
back to me, Arthur.

578
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:28,415
Good. Good.

579
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,384
Now we're going to do
the chest pass.

580
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,661
Same thing, no bounce.

581
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:34,729
Got it? Nice.

582
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,830
Hey, Coach, your shoe's untied.

583
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,800
-Made you look.
-(laughter)

584
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,296
Oh, that's very funny. Yeah.

585
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,462
(grunts)

586
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:45,267
(laughter continues)

587
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:47,500
Arthur, what the hell?

588
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,271
Sorry, Coach.

589
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:50,778
Uh, wasn't I supposed
to toss it back to you?

590
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:52,604
Yeah, but the guy
has to be ready.

591
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:54,342
-That's a crucial part
of this... -(phone ringing)

592
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:55,607
Uh...

593
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:57,477
Oh, all right. Uh, hang on.

594
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,149
You guys, uh, shoot around
a little bit.

595
00:24:59,184 --> 00:25:00,821
I'll be right back.

596
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,823
-Ball, ball, ball.
-MARCUS: Kenny.

597
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:04,924
How you doing, buddy?

598
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:07,619
How's everything going
in, uh, Seattle?

599
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:08,664
Yeah? Oh--

600
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:10,457
Hey! What the hell?!

601
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,429
Yeah, no, I'm okay.
I'll call you right back.

602
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:16,705
Guys, what are you doing?

603
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,233
Shooting around.

604
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,304
-Big balls.
-What am I looking at here?

605
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,811
Big balls celebration,

606
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,143
like when an NBA player
hits a big shot.

607
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:27,507
Big balls.

608
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,179
Oh, but you got to hit
the shot, right?

609
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:30,719
I mean, you don't celebrate
a miss.

610
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:33,821
Showtime does.
He knows all the celebrations.

611
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:35,383
He's a student of the game.

612
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,187
Aha.

613
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:38,859
Watch this.

614
00:25:38,894 --> 00:25:41,554
Do shimmies. Steph Curry.

615
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:42,797
Look at that.

616
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,128
Aha.

617
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:46,735
(laughing)

618
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,836
That is outstanding.

619
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:50,970
Hey, uh...

620
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:54,875
has he ever actually hit
one of those backward shots?

621
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,910
In the five years
I've played with him,

622
00:25:56,945 --> 00:26:00,342
he's never even hit the rim,
but he's due.

623
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,277
-Huh.
-Mm-hmm.

624
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,413
Huh, pretty impressive.

625
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,890
Hey.

626
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:11,419
Sounded like
you guys were having fun

627
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,762
-out there today, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,731
Well, Arthur gave me
a concussion,

629
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:18,228
but, uh, yeah,
other than that, pretty fun.

630
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:20,659
Oh. Well, we don't have
any insurance,

631
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:22,331
so I never heard that.

632
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,366
(laughing)

633
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:26,698
Bye, Julio.
See you Thursday, Coach.

634
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,106
Okay, Benny.

635
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:30,108
You be good.

636
00:26:30,143 --> 00:26:32,209
Please tell me
he's not gonna ride that thing.

637
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:33,540
JULIO:
Well, sure.

638
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,509
I mean, he lives
all the way across town,

639
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:38,215
so he comes back and forth
on that scooter every day.

640
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,086
MARCUS: I mean, he's gonna
kill himself. All that ice.

641
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:44,760
Well, as far as I know, he's
never had a single accident.

642
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:46,828
Uh, can you say the same?

643
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,721
Touché.

644
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:52,460
These guys are capable
of a lot more than you think.

645
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:54,099
You'd be surprised.

646
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,431

647
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:57,806

<i>Like Benny, for instance.</i>

648
00:26:57,841 --> 00:26:59,632
<i>He lives on his own.</i>

649
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,041

<i>Now, Blair is not</i>
<i>as self-sufficient.</i>

653
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,214
<i>I mean, he lives in</i>

654
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:11,919
<i>with some of the other guys.</i>

655

I guess that explains
that zoo-like aroma.

670
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:52,421
Yeah. He also refuses to shower.

-Oh.

672
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:57,932
Good evening, Coach.

Yeah. He speaks four languages.

680

That-That's not normal.

There must be
some chaos up there.

he works in a vocational school.

<i>He's a welder.</i>

691

Guys, I thought
I told you to wear blue.

711
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:48,042
I look better in red.

712
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:52,046
But it is a home game,
and home games, we wear blue.

713
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:56,050
My girlfriend is here,
and she likes me in red.

714
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,955
I'm sure your girlfriend would
like you just as much in blue.

715

Look how handsome
Craig looks in blue."

717
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,786
She isn't that corny, man.

718
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,293
She's into nasty stuff.

719
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,526

I suffer from color blindness,

00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,735

what I'm wearing.

All right.

793
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:11,641
Guys, today,
I am going to teach you

794
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:14,182
the most beautiful play
in basketball.

795
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:17,284
It's called the "pick-and-roll."

796
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:21,156
I love this play.

797
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:24,687
And when it is done right,
it gives me a hard-on.

798
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:26,194
What the hell?

799
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:28,493
Oh, sorry, Cody.
It-It's just the truth.

800
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:30,297
Will it give me a hard-on?

801
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,991
Well, if you're lucky, Marlon.

802
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:35,599
Okay.
Now, Blair, you come defend me.

803
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:37,337
Johnny, you're on my team.

804
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:38,767
Benny, you're defending Johnny.

805
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,934
Okay?

806
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,101
Now, what happens is

807
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:45,642
I start to come to the right,
toward you, Johnny.

808
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:47,776
You step up
and set a pick on Blair.

809
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:49,316
Where do I set it?

810
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:51,384
You set it right here
at his elbow.

811
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,353
Good. Good. Good.

812
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:55,454
Oh. Oh.

813
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:58,116
My God, you have
got to take a shower.

814
00:33:58,151 --> 00:33:59,854
Everyone says that.

815
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:01,823
Yeah, and everyone's right.
I mean, I'm tearing.

816
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:04,496
Okay, you setting the pick?

817
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:06,498
Okay. Do you have a pick?

818
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,203
No, you are the pick.

819
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:10,634
Be-be like a statue.

820
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:13,703
Good. And now I start
to come this way.

821
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:15,573
They both have to come out,

822
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:18,873
and that gives you
a chance to roll, Johnny.

823
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:21,381
-Roll? -Yeah.
You-you move toward the basket.

824
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:24,252
-Move toward the basket.
-But I'm a statue.

825
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:27,519
-Statues don't move.
-Forget I said "statue."

826
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:29,785
I can't.

827
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,888
Okay.

828
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:38,090
There you have it,
the pick-and-roll.

829
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,499
Did it give you
a hard-on, Coach?

830
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:44,239
No, Marlon. In fact,
I think my dick just evaporated.

831
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:46,098
That sounds serious.

832
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,606
Hmm. Yeah, it is.

833
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:57,351
Hey, did you tell your boss
we got that road game in Ames?

834
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,749
Yes, but I have a doubt.

835
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:01,850
What doubt?

836
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,918
I think he'll say yes,
but I have this doubt.

837
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:07,856
-What doubt?
-This doubt.

838
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:09,726
Okay. Okay. Fine.

839
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:13,862
Uh, if you have any more doubts,
come talk to me, all right?

840
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:16,436
Hey, Johnny. Jump in the shower.

841
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:19,703
I don't believe in showers.

842
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,804
-What does that mean?
-He's afraid of the water.

843
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,102

853
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,723
Oh.

854
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:41,725
-MARLON: That's not a rat.
-It's just a little mouse.

855
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,957
JOHNNY:
Save it, Coach.

856
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:44,629
It's gonna drown. Save it!

857
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:46,224
All right, all right,
all right. Just relax.

858
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:47,896
Take it easy. Take it easy.

859
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:50,228
It's not gonna drown.
It's all right.

860
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:51,669

Oh, no.

861
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:52,736

862
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:55,508
We got to do something.

863
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,642
-Where'd it go?!
-Down the drain.

864
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,007
It gonna drown down there,
for real.

865
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,976
During drowning,
your lungs fill with water,

866
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,483
you can't get proper oxygen,
and then...

867
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,419
Not now, Wikipedia.

868
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,487
Save him, Coach. Save him!

869
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:09,247
All right. (stammers)

870
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:11,051
Oh, no. He's...

871
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:14,626
Oh, you know what, Johnny?

872
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:16,364
You got to save him.

873
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,158
You're the animal expert,
and he will sense that,

874
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:21,259
and he will come to you.

875
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:22,601
-You got to do it, Johnny.
-Come on. You got this.

876
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:24,031
-Come on, Johnny.
-You got this. -Come on.

877
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,769
-CRAIG: That's it, Johnny.
-Come on, Johnny.

878
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:27,705
-MARLON: You can do it, Johnny.
-Johnny, y-you get--

879
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,839
No, no, Johnny, you got to,
you got to get in there,

880
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,544
and you got to look down.

881
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:34,107
You got to be able to look down,
so get under there.

882
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:35,482
Can you see?

883
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:37,143
JOHNNY:
Cutie, come out.

884
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,453
Johnny, you know what? Here.

885
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,685
You got to wash off.

886
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,688
If you don't wash off,
the mouse can smell it,

887
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,657
and you got to smell good.

888
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,054
He'll smell that you're clean,
and then he'll come to you.

889
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,188
Get under the pitters.
Under the pitters.

890
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:51,861
That's good. Great.

891
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:53,962
Take a run
at that undercarriage.

892
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:56,063
There you go. Yeah.

893
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:58,131
(stammers) But don't overdo it.

894
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,132
All right. That's good.

895
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,739
Yeah. Great, Johnny.

896
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:04,412
-Cutie, I'm clean. Come out.
-(chuckles)

897
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,205
-CRAIG: There it is.
-MARCUS: There he is!

898
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,306
-Look! He's going, guys!
-We saved him.

899
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,879
-MARCUS: There he goes!
-ARTHUR: Way to go, Johnny.

900
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:11,914
MARCUS: You freakin' saved him!
You saved him!

901
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,883
-He's free!
-You freed the mouse!

902
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:15,918
-How's that feel?
-It feels pretty good.

903
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,348
Yeah?

904
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:18,822
Give me a hug, Coach.

905
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:21,594
(chuckles) I already had...

906
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,256
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on. Come on.

907
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,598
Yeah.

908
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,259
Yay!

909
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:30,097

911
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:38,545
Well, first road game, huh?

912
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,415
-This is exciting.
-Yeah.

913
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,076
Look, the bus stop
is right over there.

914
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:44,848
Takes you right into
the heart of Ames.

915
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:47,686
Hold on. We-- Public bus?

916
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:49,622
What are you expecting, a limo?

917
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,252
-Are you coming with me?
-No.

918
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:56,464
I can't look after these guys
all by myself.

919
00:37:56,499 --> 00:38:00,435
Marcus, relax.
You'll be just fine.

920
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,570
Oh. Oh. Good news.
I forgot something.

921
00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:06,364
You're getting a player off the
injured list to replace Darius.

922
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,069
Cosentino.

923
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,874
Hell of a ballplayer, Cosentino.

924
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:12,843
All right. Happy luck.

925
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,658
-Hey.
-Hey.

926
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:27,121
(chuckles)

927
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:28,991
So, Johnny.

928
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,158
Look at you,
all fresh and clean.

929
00:38:31,193 --> 00:38:34,062
I put baby powder
on my armpits and feet.

930
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,899
(chuckles):
Great.

931
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:38,473
Okay. Uh...

932
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,640
Hold it. Where's Benny?

933
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:42,675
He had to work. He texted me.

934
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,105
Again?

935
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,337
Yep.

936
00:38:45,372 --> 00:38:47,273
(groans)

937
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,177
Okay, so I guess we're
just waiting on this Cosentino.

938
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:51,816
Cosentino had
a Grade 2 ankle sprain.

939
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,345
Just came back off
from the injured reserve

940
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,588
for kicking ass.

941
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,920
Kicking ass. I like that.

942
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,757
No, literally,
kicked some guy in the ass.

943
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,451
Huh.

944
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:02,321

997

do you know much about

998

the history of public transit?

It's fascinating.

1000
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,293

00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:55,967
I got Adele over there

1018
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,672

that says "no singing."

1021
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:03,040
They can't be throwing things.

00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:44,666
I'm a woman in my 40s.

1220
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:46,635
I don't have time for bullshit,
all right?

1221
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,241
Do you know what I do
during the weekday?

1222
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,737
-No.
-I perform Shakespeare

1223
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:52,069
for middle school kids
right after lunch.

1224
00:49:52,104 --> 00:49:53,840
Um, do you know
what middle school kids

1225
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:55,512
want to be doing
right after lunch?

1226
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:56,909
No.

1227
00:49:56,944 --> 00:49:58,746
It ain't Shakespeare.

1228
00:49:58,781 --> 00:49:59,846
It's exhausting, but
it's acting, and I love acting.

1229
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:02,915
So, after that,
I go home and I do

1230
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,357
a lot of freelance bookkeeping
because Shakespeare--

1231
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:06,853
and brace yourself here,
this might blow your mind--

1232
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:10,758
-doesn't pay so much.
-(chuckles)

1233
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:12,199

Johnny from work,

1234
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:13,761
and we spend
the whole afternoon together.

1235
00:50:13,796 --> 00:50:15,994
And I love him very much,
but it's exhausting.

1236
00:50:16,029 --> 00:50:17,666
And then I make dinner
with my mom,

1237
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:19,701

with Johnny,

1238
00:50:19,736 --> 00:50:22,473
and if I have any energy left
at the end of the night,

1239
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:24,640

1240

1243

you were...

1245
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:40,656

01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:12,057
and-and Cody and Craig
and-and Blair.

1733
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:13,630
They're all excited.

1734
01:10:13,665 --> 01:10:15,192
No, no. He doesn't
have to move into a home.

1735
01:10:15,227 --> 01:10:16,996
He's got everything
he needs right here.

1736

Plus, we have so much fun,

1737

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1738
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,330
But, Johnny, you told me...

1739
01:10:21,365 --> 01:10:23,002
This doesn't involve you.

1740

1741
01:10:36,182 --> 01:10:37,720

Uh, thank you so much
for everything.

1744
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:44,529
This has been fabulous.

-He came to dinner.

home in years...

1749

-Johnny invited him.
-Johnny invited him.

Wh-What are you doing?

1762
01:11:27,174 --> 01:11:30,938
Uh... waiting on an Uber.

1763
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,908
Come on, are you just
gonna run away?

No.

Well, yeah. I mean...

1766
01:11:40,114 --> 01:11:44,248
I just wasn't feeling
terribly welcome.

1767
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:48,956
Hey, by the way,
I love your mom.

1768
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,925
She's very colorful.

1769
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,433
Okay.
Why'd you come here tonight?

1770
01:11:55,635 --> 01:11:57,767
Meat loaf Mondays.
You invited me.

1771
01:11:57,802 --> 01:11:59,637
I didn't invite you. Johnny did.

1772
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,102
Okay.

1773
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:05,940

1774
01:12:05,975 --> 01:12:07,975
I mean, come on.

1775
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,142
What are we doing here?

1776
01:12:10,177 --> 01:12:13,079
You don't want me
to come to your house.

1777
01:12:13,114 --> 01:12:15,752
We got to sneak off under
the bleachers to steal a kiss.

1778
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:18,018
Like, you know,
we're not in junior high.

Look, I-I...
I like to keep my personal life

1784
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,360
and my family life separate,
okay?

1785
01:12:34,135 --> 01:12:35,871
I just know from experience

1786
01:12:35,906 --> 01:12:38,643
that if I get involved
with a guy, you know,

1787
01:12:38,678 --> 01:12:43,472
and Johnny finds out about it,
then he gets attached.

1788
01:12:43,507 --> 01:12:47,784
And if it doesn't work out,
then he can get very hurt,

1789
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:49,082
and I... I won't do that to him.

1790
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:54,219
Okay.

the basketballs out,

I-I want to try

That-That's okay, Marlon.
That's fine.

to just, you know,
get that picture in your mind

2125

And I'm going to the NBA,
to Seattle,

2129
01:29:25,376 --> 01:29:28,982
because they hired me
to coach up there!

2130
01:29:32,152 --> 01:29:35,857
Seattle... sucks.

2131
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:39,861
Well, i-it's an expansion team.

01:29:39,896 --> 01:29:41,698
You know, it's a process.

2133
01:29:41,733 --> 01:29:44,602
Well, who's gonna coach us
next season, then?

2134
01:29:45,737 --> 01:29:47,836
I-I don't know. Maybe Julio.

2135

Good guys don't leave!

2136
01:29:50,335 --> 01:29:53,006
Yeah, Johnny, they do.

When the NBA calls, they leave.

2138
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:59,716

Great news.

2151
01:30:48,767 --> 01:30:51,295
Yeah, I, uh...

2152
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:56,267
got an NBA job in Seattle,
third assistant.

2153
01:30:56,302 --> 01:30:59,567
Which means, you know,
I-I'll be on the bench,

2154
01:30:59,602 --> 01:31:01,712
not one of those schmucks
sitting in the second row.

Yeah, it's a...

2157
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,080
pretty big deal.

2158
01:31:07,115 --> 01:31:08,543
Wow.

2159
01:31:08,578 --> 01:31:11,315
That's... that's great.

2160
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:12,789
Yeah.

2161
01:31:12,824 --> 01:31:14,120
Did you tell The Friends?

2162
01:31:14,155 --> 01:31:15,484
Yeah. Yeah.

2163
01:31:15,519 --> 01:31:17,959
Uh...

2164
01:31:17,994 --> 01:31:21,996
They weren't exactly thrilled,
uh... (chuckles)

2165
01:31:22,031 --> 01:31:27,562
as you might imagine, and, uh,
Johnny, pissed at me, again.

2166
01:31:27,597 --> 01:31:29,333
Hmm. Yeah. Of course he's upset.

2167
01:31:29,368 --> 01:31:31,973
He's attached to you.
They all are.

2168
01:31:33,438 --> 01:31:36,505
Man, what does it take
to get an "attaboy" around here?

2169
01:31:37,684 --> 01:31:39,442
I'm sorry. Congratulations.

2170
01:31:39,477 --> 01:31:41,411

2171
01:31:41,446 --> 01:31:43,853
Thank you.

2172

Really, I-I owe it all
to The Friends.

I, uh... (chuckles)

2174
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:52,158
Apparently, Seattle's getting
roughed up in the press,

2175
01:31:52,193 --> 01:31:54,996
needed a feel-good story,
you know,

2176
01:31:55,031 --> 01:31:57,493
to change the subject,
and, uh...

2177

though, isn't it?

2180
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:08,009
No. I'm not exploiting anybody.

2181
01:32:08,044 --> 01:32:11,947
I'm... I would...
I would never...

2182

You know that I love these guys.

2183
01:32:16,217 --> 01:32:19,515
I mean, you were court ordered
to care, so... (chuckles)

2184
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:20,857
It's not exactly the same.

2185
01:32:20,892 --> 01:32:23,057
That's not fair. You...

2186
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,259
I thought we were okay.

2187
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:31,395
Why are you being
so shitty about this?

2188
01:32:34,202 --> 01:32:36,466

get to drop into our lives

2189

you telling me

2191
01:32:43,948 --> 01:32:47,675
that you have no interest
in getting involved.

2192
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,051
Yeah, I did,
and then it changed.

2193
01:32:50,086 --> 01:32:51,514
And you know it changed.

2194
01:32:51,549 --> 01:32:53,351
Okay.
I knew they changed for me.

2195
01:32:53,386 --> 01:32:55,925
I didn't know they changed
for you until just now.

2196
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,257
Happy to hear you
acknowledge that.

when they double Darius,

you're gonna roll to the basket.
